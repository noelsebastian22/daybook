# Session log

Shared memory across Cowork, Claude Code and Command Code. No agent can see another's
conversation; this file is the handoff.

Not a changelog — git covers that. This records **intent, dead ends, and open threads**:
the things that live in a conversation and would otherwise die with it.

Written by the `session-handoff` skill. Newest entry first. Never edit a past entry; if
it turned out wrong, say so in a new one.

## 2026-08-17 · cowork · build plan becomes single source of truth

**Did**
- Folded the whole Notion spec into `BUILD-PLAN.md`. It now carries the product definition, tech stack, all 16 features with per-feature state, signature interactions, interaction rules, pages, UI direction, capture syntax, the data model, rollover logic, locked decisions, out-of-scope, backlog, known gaps and platform gotchas. Numbered sections 1 to 13.
- Removed the separate "Spec coverage" status tables. Feature state now lives on each feature in §5 and nowhere else, so there is one place to update rather than two that drift.
- `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` repointed: `BUILD-PLAN.md` named as the single source of truth, Notion marked historical.
- `session-handoff` skill step 4 rewritten. Was "update the phase status table"; now lists the five sections that can go stale (§3 phase status, §5 features, §4 remaining work, §9 decisions, §12 known gaps) and says never to update Notion.

**Decided**
- **`BUILD-PLAN.md` is the single source of truth, and the Notion page is frozen.** Two live documents means two states of truth and the one nobody has open goes stale. The repo wins because it is what an agent reads at the start of a session, it versions with the code, and a decision and the code implementing it land in the same commit. The Notion page stays as the original brief for provenance.
- **Feature state is tracked per-feature in §5, never in a summary table.** A status table beside a feature list is duplication, and the table is what silently rots.

**Open**
- Unchanged from the entry below. Nothing has been exercised through a real signed-in session, `npm install` has not been run on the Mac, Google OAuth is unconfigured, there is no offline write queue, PWA icons are the Angular defaults, and nothing reads `user_settings.timezone`.
- The Notion page has no banner saying it is historical. Anyone opening it directly will not know. Left alone on purpose: this session should not write to Notion when it just declared Notion frozen.

**Next**
Unchanged: `npm install && npm start`, sign in with the magic link, put a real day through the app. Then Phase 3, starting with task-as-object since the router already has `withViewTransitions()`.

**Touched** — `BUILD-PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `.agents/skills/session-handoff/SKILL.md`, `docs/SESSIONS.md`

## 2026-08-17 · cowork · phases 1 and 2 built from spec

**Did**
- Read the Notion spec (`Daily To-Do App - Project Spec`) and audited it. Seven gaps found; six fixed this session, listed under Decided.
- Supabase project `daybook` created (`zzacswfongmzpnhcjiqp`, ap-southeast-2, free tier). `sweep` keeps the other active slot; the old paused `noelsebastian22's Project` was left alone, not deleted.
- Migration `0001_core_schema.sql`: `categories`, `tasks`, `day_snapshots`, `user_settings`, RLS owner-only on all four.
- Migration `0002_rpcs.sql`: `ensure_user_setup(text)`, `rollover_and_snapshot(date)`. Both `SECURITY DEFINER`, both revoked from `anon`/`public`. `get_advisors` clean after the revoke.
- Angular 22.1.2 scaffold, zoneless, standalone, Tailwind v4 via `.postcssrc.json`, `@angular/pwa`.
- `core/`: `supabase.ts`, `session.store.ts`, `task.store.ts`, `toast.store.ts`, `auth.guard.ts` (+`guestGuard`), `dates.ts`, `parse-capture.ts`, `models.ts`.
- `features/login` (Google + magic-link fallback), `features/today` (capture box, energy filter, task list, collapsed Upcoming strip), `shared/toasts.ts`.
- Rollover verified live against the real DB with a seeded 4-day gap: 4 snapshot rows written, 1 task rolled, future-dated task untouched, second run a no-op, `current_date + 400` clamped to server+1. Test user deleted afterwards; all four tables back to 0 rows.
- `ng build` 486.78 kB initial / 121.86 kB transferred, lazy chunks for `today` (63.12 kB) and `login` (39.05 kB). `ng test` 10/10.
- Source unpacked to `~/Website Dev/todo/daybook`. `npm install` not yet run there.

**Decided**
- **`carried_over_count` counts days slipped, not rollover runs.** The spec said "increments each time a task rolls over". That makes the number depend on how often the app is opened — a task ignored for a week reads 1 if you open the app once, 7 if you open it daily. Same avoidance, different number. Now `+= (v_today - scheduled_date)`.
- **`day_snapshots` are written for every day in the gap, not just the closing day.** The spec's single-row-per-run design loses Friday and Saturday when you skip a weekend. The RPC loops from the last snapshot to today, and each day counts every task open on that date (`scheduled_date <= day`), not only tasks sitting exactly on it.
- **`categories` and `user_settings` tables added.** Neither was in the spec. `tasks.category_id` referenced a table that did not exist; Phase 5 needs somewhere to put digest prefs, timezone and the push subscription.
- **RLS added on all four tables.** The spec never mentioned it. Without it the publishable key reads the whole database.
- **First-login setup is an idempotent RPC, not a trigger on `auth.users`.** Triggers on that table fail in ways that are painful to debug and can block sign-up entirely.
- **An unknown `#tag` creates the category** rather than silently dropping it. Dropping input the user clearly meant is worse than an occasional stray category, and categories are trivial to delete.
- **Magic link ships alongside Google and stays afterwards.** Google needs manual Google Cloud config; the fallback makes Phase 1 testable now and is a useful recovery path later.
- **`@ngrx/signals` on `22.0.0-rc.0`.** Stable 21.x peer-requires Angular 21. Reverting to Angular 21 LTS is a one-command change if the RC misbehaves.
- App named **Daybook**, chosen over Cairn / Tide / Carryover. Repo folder is `todo/daybook`.

**Didn't work**
- **`ng new` refuses to run on Node 22.22.2.** Angular 22 CLI hard-requires 22.22.3 / 24.15.0 / 26+. `nodejs.org` downloads are blocked in this container (403), and `@nodejs/node-linux-x64` does not exist. The path that worked: `npm pack node-linux-x64@24.15.0`, extract to `/opt/node24`, then shim `npm`/`npx` to run the existing npm CLI under that binary. Only relevant to cloud sessions; a local machine will not hit this.
- **`npm i @ngrx/signals` fails with ERESOLVE on Angular 22.** Latest stable is 21.1.1 and peers Angular 21. Needs the explicit `@22.0.0-rc.0`, not `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- **Tailwind v4 does not import cleanly from a `.scss` global stylesheet.** Sass tries to resolve `tailwindcss` as a Sass module. Switched the global sheet to `src/styles.css` and repointed `angular.json`; component styles can still be scss.
- **The Supabase security linter flags `SECURITY DEFINER` functions even when they `raise exception` on a null `auth.uid()`.** The `raise` is real protection but the linter only reads grants. Explicit `revoke ... from anon, public` clears it.
- First attempt at the RPC returned `rolled_count` correct but assigned `scheduled_date` before computing the day delta — the `update` sets both columns from the *old* row values in Postgres, so the ordering in the SET clause does not matter. Verified rather than assumed.

**Open**
- **Nothing has been exercised through a real signed-in session.** Every rollover path was proven with a seeded auth user and `set local request.jwt.claims`, but no human has signed in, added a task or completed one. `npm install` has not been run in the repo on the Mac.
- **Google OAuth is not configured.** Button renders and calls `signInWithOAuth`, Supabase will reject it until the Google Cloud client ID and secret are pasted in. Steps are in `README.md`.
- **No offline write queue.** Optimistic updates cover an in-session drop; a write made with no connection is lost on reload. iOS has no Background Sync API, so this has to be a foreground replay queue in `TaskStore`.
- **PWA icons are the Angular schematic defaults.** Purple Angular shield, not a Daybook icon.
- `user_settings.timezone` is written by `ensure_user_setup` and read by nothing.
- No hosting. No CI. Not deployed anywhere.

**Next**
Run `npm install && npm start` in `~/Website Dev/todo/daybook`, sign in with the magic link, and put a real day through it: add a task with `call physio thursday 2pm #physio !quick`, confirm the chips render and the row lands on Thursday in the Upcoming strip, complete something and check the timestamp. That is the first real proof the whole loop works. Then Phase 3.
